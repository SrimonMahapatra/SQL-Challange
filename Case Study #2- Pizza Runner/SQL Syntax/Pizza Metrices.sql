ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning & Transformation
ðŸ”¨ Table: customer_orders
Looking at the customer_orders table below, we can see that there are

In the exclusions column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.
In the extras column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.

Our Course of action to clean the table:

Create a temporary table with all the columns
Remove null values in exlusions and extras columns and replace with blank space ' '.

drop table if exists;
create temp table customer_orders_temp as 
select 
	order_id,
	customer_id,
	pizza_id,
	case 
			when exclusions is null or exclusions like 'null' then ''
			else exclusions
			end as exclusions,
	case
			when extras is null or extras like 'null' then ''
			else extras
			end as extras,
	order_time
